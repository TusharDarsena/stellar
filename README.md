# 🎟️ Stellar Ticketing

NFT event ticketing on Stellar. Built with Soroban.

[![Stellar Ticketing CI/CD](https://github.com/TusharDarsena/stellar/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TusharDarsena/stellar/actions)

Stellar Ticketing is a decentralized platform for event management and NFT ticketing. It leverages Soroban smart contracts to handle event creation, ticket minting, escrowed payments, and restricted resales with automatic royalty enforcement. Attendees enjoy a "crypto-less" experience via Burner Wallets and rotating QR codes for secure entry.

## 📖 How to Use (Step by Step)

### For Organizers
1.  **Connect**: Link your Freighter wallet to the dashboard.
2.  **Create**: Set up an event with name, date, capacity, and XLM price.
3.  **Manage**: Track sales and revenue in real-time.
4.  **Verify**: Use the built-in scanner to check attendees in at the door.

### For Attendees
1.  **Sign In**: Use Google or email (Burner Wallet generated automatically).
2.  **Browse**: Explore upcoming events on the Stellar network.
3.  **Purchase**: Buy tickets with XLM. Funds are held in escrow until the event.
4.  **Enter**: Show your dynamic, rotating QR code at the venue.

See the full [User Guide](docs/architecture.md) for more technical details.

## 📜 Contract Functions Explained

### Ticket Contract
- `create_event`: Initializes a new event with metadata and pricing.
- `purchase`: Mints a ticket NFT to the buyer and holds XLM in escrow.
- `verify_entry`: Validates a signed QR payload against the owner's address.
- `cancel_event`: Triggers automatic refund logic for all ticket holders.

### Marketplace Contract
- `list_ticket`: Creates a resale listing for a ticket NFT.
- `buy_listing`: Executes the transfer, ensuring royalties are paid to the organizer.
- `cancel_listing`: Removes a ticket from the marketplace.

---

## 🔒 Security Checklist

### Smart Contracts
- [x] `address.require_auth()` on all guarded functions
- [x] `checked_*` arithmetic for all I128 operations
- [x] Escrowed funds isolated per event
- [x] Restricted transfer logic for royalties
- [x] Persistent storage for long-term data

### Frontend
- [x] Client-side transaction simulation before submission
- [x] Burner Wallet keys stored securely in `localStorage`
- [x] No hardcoded contract addresses (uses `.env`)
- [x] QR payloads timestamped and signed to prevent replay attacks

## 🔍 Monitoring & Observability

Monitor contract interactions and event health via Stellar's public infrastructure.

- **Stellar Expert**: View ticket mints and marketplace transfers in real-time.
- **Soroban RPC**: Logs for transaction simulation and submission.
- **Contract Events**: All state changes emit standard Soroban events for indexing.

## 🗂 Data Indexing

We utilize Soroban's event system to discover and display platform data.

- **Event Discovery**: `SorobanRpc.getEvents()` is used to find all `create_event` calls.
- **Ticket Library**: Filters on-chain events to find tickets owned by the current wallet.
- **History**: Transaction logs provide a full audit trail of purchases and transfers.

## 🛡️ Technical Deep Dive

### Rotating QR Codes (D-027)
To prevent ticket duplication, our platform uses rotating QR codes. Every 30 seconds, a new payload is generated containing:
1. `ticket_id`
2. `current_timestamp`
3. `signature` (signed by the attendee's Burner Wallet)

The venue scanner verifies the signature and ensures the timestamp is within a ±30s window.

### Burner Wallets (D-028)
Attendees shouldn't need to understand seed phrases. We generate a one-time `Keypair` on the fly, store the secret in the browser, and fund it via Friendbot for a seamless onboarding experience.
